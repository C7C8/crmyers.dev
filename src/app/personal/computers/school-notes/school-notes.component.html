    <h1>University Notes</h1>

    <p>
        I have a <span matTooltip="Spatial dysgraphia and developmental coordination disorder" matTooltipShowDelay="1500" matTooltipPosition="before">pair of conditions</span>
        that affect my handwriting; for me, writing a sentence is like doing 5 finger lifts of a heavy textbook, and
        my writing is always sloppy &amp; cramped. While this definitely nudged me in the direction of computers, it made
        taking notes &mdash; especially math &mdash; extremely difficult and painful. With handwriting I can't keep up
        with professors and the pain is a serious distraction. During the first few weeks of my first term of university,
        I got C's and D's on all my Calculus III quizzes because I couldn't learn effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, I was able to figure out a way around it! I learned <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
        specifically so I could take math notes, and augmented Vim with various plugins for autocomplete, templating,
        and live previews of the code I was writing. Since my typing ability is unaffected (and I'm a fast typist)
        I started live-TeX-ing my notes out in class and was able to keep up. My grades rose, my pain went away, and
        now I have a library of notes to share.

        The below does not represent all the courses that I took at WPI, for some <span matTooltip="Don't judge me, ok? Some classes were easier than others!">
        I never took notes for</span>, while for others the notes aren't in good enough quality to share. You can browse
        through them all by subject here with a PDF preview in-browser; a download button is below if you want an offline
        copy of the document.
